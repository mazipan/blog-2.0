The good things is Wordpress already releasing it's [Gutenberg ↗️](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) that giving so many improvement in the writing experience.

I prefer Nuxt because it's focus in delivering a better DX for Vue Developer. We can generate static website easier in Nuxt, Sitemap, PWA, Feed and many other cool things. After develop [smesummit.id ↗️](https://www.smesummit.id/) and [Quran Offline ↗️](https://www.quran-offline.xyz), it give me more confidence to implement same approach to generate my own static blog using latest technology in Vue.
