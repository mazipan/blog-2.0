But since I\'m not familiar with Wordpress, the Blog is pretty far from my own expectations in term of <em>User Interface</em> (UI), Speed, and <em>Developer Experience</em> (DX). The good things is Wordpress already releasing it\'s <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">Gutenberg ↗️</a> that giving so many improvement in the writing experience. After upgrade to Gutenberg from Classic Editor, I decide to leave Medium.com and write in Wordpress (again) and success writing some articles using Gutenberg. But I am not satisfy with the DX when using Wordpress, as a <em>Frontend Developer</em> that have poor skill in PHP.</p>\n<h2>Time for Vue 😎</h2>\n<p>I already worked with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue ↗️</a> in the past few years and falling in love with the DX. Recently I made <a href="https://www.smesummit.id/">smesummit.id ↗️</a> and <a href="https://www.quran-offline.xyz">Quran Offline ↗️</a> using <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt.js ↗️</a> - The Vue.js Framework. I prefer Nuxt because it\'s focus in delivering a better DX for Vue Developer. We can generate static website easier in Nuxt, Sitemap, PWA, Feed and many other cool things. After develop <a href="https://www.smesummit.id/">smesummit.id ↗️</a> and <a href="https://www.quran-offline.xyz">Quran Offline ↗️</a>, it give me more confidence to implement same approach to generate my own static blog using latest technology in Vue. The big problem is I never learn about using Nuxt as Blog generator, luckily I found this article &quot;<a href="https://marinaaisa.com/blog/blog-using-vue-nuxt-markdown/">Website with blog and portfolio using Vue.js + Nuxt + Markdown ↗️</a>&quot; by <a href="https://twitter.com/MarinaAisa">Marina Aísa ↗️</a> and she open the codes. Based on her article and after seeing the code, I creating this Blog 2.0.</p>\n<p>With Blog 2.0, I have full control in my Blog. I can tweak the UI, improving page load speeds and adding new content easier than I ever imagine.</p>\n<h2>Unboxing 📦</h2>\n<p>Behind this Blog 2.0, <code>nuxt@2.4.3</code> is installed as main framework that organize all the things. Adding <code>@nuxtjs/pwa</code>, <code>@nuxtjs/sitemap</code> and <code>nuxt-webfontloader</code> module to this Nuxt Application.</p>\n<p><a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism.js ↗️</a> for syntax highlighter, <a href="https://github.com/mazipan/vue-tiny-lazyload-img">Vue Tiny Lazy Load ↗️</a> for lazy loading image using Intersection Observer API.</p>\n<p>For UI, I only adding <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize">modern-normalize ↗️</a> by <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/">Sindre Sorhus ↗️</a> and craft from scratch for the UI layouting and styling. I highly inspired by simplicity UI in Dan\'s <a href="https://overreacted.io/">Overreacted.io ↗️</a> and pick color scheme from <a href="https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme">Dracula Theme ↗️</a>. I also pick some <code>helpers</code> from Dan\'s repo.</p>\n<h2>It\'s still Beta 🍼</h2>\n<p>It\'s still beta, I even have no clue about Domain I should use for this Blog 2.0. This is just for proof of concept (POC) in developing static blog using Nuxt.js. Still far away from <em>perfecto</em>, but I believe this is a good baby step.</p>\n<p>If you interest how this Blog 2.0 built, you can see the codes in this link: <a href="https://github.com/mazipan/blog-2.0">https://github.com/mazipan/blog-2.0 ↗️</a></p>\n'}}}]);
