This static blog usually uses templates like * Markdown * that will * build * shortly before * deploy * to produce static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>\n<h2>What is Gridsome?</h2>\n<img v-lazyload src="/images/placeholder-1x1.png" data-src="https://gridsome.org/logos/logo-normal-dark.svg" alt="Gridsome Logo" height="200px" width="200px">\n<p><a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome ↗️</a> is a new kid in the Vue.js ecosystem that specializes in creating static pages. If you are a React.js user, of course you are familiar with the name <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby ↗️</a> as one of the best static page generator at the moment. Well, Gridsome was very inspired by Gatsby in the React.js ecosystem.</p>\n<p>It\'s not new that the ecosystem in Vue is not as strong as and as complete as React, but I am always amazed by those who are struggling to make alternatives to many great things to react to Vue. Gridsome, like will follow the success of Nuxt in trying to adopt Next.js on React. Nuxt today has become the best choice when making an any application on Vue.</p>\n<h2>Why is Gridsome better than Nuxt?</h2>\n<p>Nuxt is basically intended to create web applications in Vue that require rendering on a server, Nuxt is more specifically very prepared to handle a variety of complex needs that usually arise when creating a web application. Although Nuxt has the ability to generate static files that we can use to create static blogs, actually this is a function that is nice to have for Nuxt.</p>\n<p>While Gridsome is a player who has specialists in this section. Gridsome has <em>generate</em> features that are armed with various <em>built-in</em> other features needed when creating static blogs such as automatic <em>code-splitting</em>, image compression, full PWA support, and of course the very friendly with SEO. We can also easily organize our content files with <strong>Markdown</strong> without the need for any additional configuration. If you look at the <a href="/blog-2-0-in-nuxtjs">Blog 2.0 repository↗️</a> that I made with Nuxt, of course you will know that I have to do various &quot;cheats&quot; to do the same thing.</p>\n<img v-lazyload src="/images/placeholder-1x1.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gridsome/gridsome.org/master/docs/images/how-it-works.png" alt="How Gridsome Works" height="200px" width="200px">\n<h2>Create awesome blog with Gridsome</h2>\n<p>Creating a blog with Gridsome is now made easier by the <em>starter template</em> which in my opinion is quite complete for the general needs of a blog.</p>\n<p>Gridsome already make a starter <a href="https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome-starter-blog">gridsome-starter-blog ↗️</a> that you can use quickly and easily for the first time. Using a starter like this will reduce a lot of burden up front to do many configurations which of course will be confusing for beginners like me.</p>\n<p>Here are more or less the steps to creating a blog using Gridsome\'s template starter:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Install Gridsome CLI</strong></p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install --global @gridsome/cli\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>2.
